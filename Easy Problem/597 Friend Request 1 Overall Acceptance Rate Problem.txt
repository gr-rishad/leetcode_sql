SOLUTION::
-------------------
solution 1::
--------------
SELECT round(ifnull(sum(B)/SUM(A),0.0) ,2) as result
FROM
(
SELECT  0 A,COUNT(*) as B
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id,accepter_id
FROM 597_requestaccepted) as A
UNION All
SELECT COUNT(*) as A,0 B
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id,send_to_id as sendRequest
FROM 597_friendrequest)as B) as C;

solution 2::
--------------
SELECT round(ifnull((totalAccept/totalSend),0.00),2) as accept_rate
FROM
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id,accepter_id)as totalAccept, COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id,send_to_id) as totalSend
FROM 597_requestaccepted as a, 597_friendrequest as f)as t
