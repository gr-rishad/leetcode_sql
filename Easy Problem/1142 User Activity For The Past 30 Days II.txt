TABLE SAME AS 1141


SOLUTION::
-----------------------

select round(ifnull(count(distinct session_id)/count(distinct user_id), 0),2) as average_sessions_per_user
from 1141_activity
where datediff('2019-07-27', activity_date) <= 30;

SELECT ifnull(round(AVG(a.num),2),0.00)
FROM
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as num
FROM 1141_activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY user_id)a
